  	<p>
    	When learning a new programming language, i've often wondered what it would be like to maintain a journal summarizing what i
    	had learned during each day. Doing this would serve to help cement what i had learned that day by forcing myself to rephrase my
    	discoveries in my own words. At the same time, others who were interested in learning the same language might be interested in
    	reading how i went about learning the language and even following along if they were so inclined. And since these blogs are hosted
    	on github, there could be a one-to-one correspondence with learning exercises that i do and projects to demonstrate the actual
    	source code, on my normal github page.
  	</p>
  	<p>
    	Currently i am working on a few books on leanpub.com (see <a href="https://leanpub.com/raven/">here</a> for a book of poetry i am working on); leanpub lets
    	people work on publishing something while allowing others to buy what has been written so far using paypal, then receiving free
    	updates as the book proceeds along. This is similar to what these blogs with BAT being tipped to me might be like, except that someone
    	who tips in BAT wouldn't know when an update to the work was done. My current thinking is that I will work on one or more of the
			above blogs every
    	day, and then at a certain time (one month? two months?) will transfer the existing blog entries to leanpub in the form of
			one or more books.
    	This would allow people who were following the blogs to buy a whole bunch of entries stuck together into one file, rather than
    	clicking on a gazillion links trying to find some specific piece of information.
