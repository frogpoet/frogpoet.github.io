    <h3>What are the above blogs about?</h3>
  <p>
    When learning a new programming language, i've often wondered what it would be like to maintain a journal summarizing what i
    had learned during each day. Doing this would serve to help cement what i had learned that day by forcing myself to rephrase my
    discoveries in my own words. At the same time, others who were interested in learning the same language might be interested in
    reading how i went about learning the language and even following along if they were so inclined. And since this blog is hosted
    on github, there could be a one-to-one correspondence with learning exercises that i do and projects to demonstrate the actual
    source code, on my normal github page.

    Currently i am working on a few books on leanpub.com (see <a href="https://leanpub.com/raven/">here</a> for a book of poetry i am working on); leanpub lets
    people work on publishing something while allowing others to buy what has been written so far using paypal, then receiving free
    updates as the book proceeds along. This is similar to what this blog with BAT being tipped to me might be like, except that someone
    who tips in BAT wouldn't know when an update to the work was done. My current thinking is that I will work on the above blog every
    day, and then at a certain time (one month? two months?) will transfer the existing blog entries to leanpub in the form of a book.
    This would allow people who were following the blog to buy a whole bunch of entries stuck together into one file, rather than
    clicking on a gazillion links trying to find some specific piece of information.
